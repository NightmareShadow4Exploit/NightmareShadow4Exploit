<h2>Binary numbers</h2>
<p>There are few different bases that we can use for our numbering systems and the one of them is base 10</p>
<p>The base 10 numbering system is what we commonly use every day. It's called "base 10" because it's based on 10 digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.</p>

<p>
    Imagine you have some boxes to represent numbers. Each box can hold a certain number of things:</p>

    <h4><li>Units: These are like individual boxes. They can hold numbers from 0 to 9.</li></h4>
    <h4><li>Tens: When you fill up 10 individual boxes, you put them all in one bigger box called a "ten." So, you can count from 0 to 9 in the units place before you need to start using the tens place.</li></h4>
    <h4><li>Hundreds: When you fill up 10 tens boxes, you put them all in one bigger box called a "hundred." So, you can count from 0 to 9 in the tens place before needing to start using the hundreds place.</li></h4>
    <h4><li>Thousands: When you fill up 10 hundreds boxes, you put them all in one bigger box called a "thousand." So, you can count from 0 to 9 in the hundreds place before needing to start using the thousands place.</li></h4>
<br>
<p>
When you count in the base 10 system: <br> <br> 

    You start with the units place (0 to 9). <br>
    When you reach 9 in the units place and need to add 1 more, you reset the units place to 0 and add 1 to the tens place.<br>
    When you reach 9 in the tens place and need to add 1 more, you reset the tens place to 0 and add 1 to the hundreds place.<br>
    The same pattern continues for the hundreds and thousands places.<br>
<br>
So, in simple terms, each place (units, tens, hundreds, thousands) can hold numbers from 0 to 9. When you go beyond 9 in any place, you start a new count in the next place to the left. That's how the base 10 system helps us keep track of numbers using units, tens, hundreds, and thousands!<br>

<h2>Processor Modes and Registers</h2>
<h3>Modes of Operation:</h3>
<br>
<li>Protected Mode: The native processor state</li>
<li>Real Address Mode: Implements early Intel Programming enivronment with the abiltity to switch modes</li>
<li>System Management Mode: Provides an operating system with mechanisms for power management and security</li>


<p>The Protected Mode means the processor is in by default mode and its the one you're most commonly going to be using throught all time that you're programming on x86 based devices </p>

<p>The idea of protected mode is that multiple processes can run but each given their own section of memory and they have to stay within that section of memory, so they can't interect with other processes,   1:01</p>
